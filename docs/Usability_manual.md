# Usability manual

## Introduction

Once we are in Bookkers we found ourselfs in the home page. There we can use the app in 3 modes: visit, logged user, logged admin.

When entering Bookkers we will find the home page. The use of the application is divided into 3 sections of operation: visit (user not logged in), user logged in and administrator  logged in.

## Visit

By using bookkers without logging in, the functionalities offered by bookers are reduced. With the navbar you can navegate through the buttons, with **Books** we can see all the books that have been published in Bookkers and by clicking on them, we can see their title, genre, author, description and isbn. By means of the button **Sing Up** we will be able to create a new user. If we have an account already created, we can log into Bookkers using the **Log In** button and thus access the other Bookkers functionalities. In addition, in ** About Us ** we will access the GitHub repository on the frontend of our application in a new tab.

## Logged User

Once the session is started, we can access more functionalities. In **MyProfile** we can see our username and profile photo, including the option to edit our profile, changing our information. As a Bookkers user, we can add new books to the application, providing the necessary data, as well as an image corresponding to the book to be published. When viewing the information of the Bookkers books, in case of being a book created by the logged in user, he/she can edit the information of the book, also, we can see the **reviews** of the books made by other Bookkers users and also leave our own **reviews** that will include a comment and a score. If we made a mistake, we can edit the **reviews** that we have made. In addition, we can give **like** to the reviews that we think are positive. On the other hand, if a **review** seems inappropriate or offensive to us, we can create a **report** so that one of the Bookkers administrators will review the **review** and delete it if necessary. Finally, you can see all the users present in the application.

## User admin

If we use a user with administrator permissions, in addition to all the above functionalities, we will have extra powers to manage the application. We will have access to a button, in the view of a book, that allows to see the **reports** made to the **reviews** that will be considered inappropriate by other Bookkers users. If we consider a **review** to be inappropriate or offensive, either through our own judgment or a **report**, we can remove the **review** by clicking the red button. If a book does not meet the Bookkers requirements either because there is erroneous or inappropriate information, we can remove it from the application using the delete button. In addition, when we view Bookkers users, we can delete users, either due to our judgment or inappropriate behavior (without being able to delete the logged in admin account).
