## Assumptions

- The use of a review detail view was not found necessary, since all the necessary information about the review is displayed in the Single Book view.
- It was not found necessary to make a view for other users other than the logged, since there is a view where you can see all the information that was found necessary for each user.
- It was not found necessary to make a report details view, since in case the admin is logged in, he can see all the reports, with all the information that was found necessary.
